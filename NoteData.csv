There is  a  house  in  New Orleans,

They call the Rising Sun.
-10 -10  -10  -7   7   8  -8-6 -6 -6   -6
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
 -6  -6  -6  6 5  6   -6
And God, I  know  I'm one.

My  mother was a tailor,

Sewed  my new blue jeans.

Down in New Orleans.

Now the onl--y   thing a gambler needs,
-10 -10 -10 -10   9  8   8
Is   a  suitcase and a trunk,
-10 -10 -10 -10   9    7   -8-6
And the   o-nly time he'll be,
-6  -6  7   -6  -6   -6  6 5 6   -6
Sa-tisfied, is when he's a-ll a drunk.

-5  -6 -7   7    8   -8  -6 
Oh mother tell your  children,
-6  -10 -10 -10  9  8     8
Not  to do what  I have done.
  10   -7    7    8  -8  -6 -6-6-6
Spend your lives in sin and misery,
-6 -6    -6  -6  6   5  6   -6
In the house of the rising sun.

{Word's}   -10 -10  -10  9  7   -8  -6 
Well I've  got one foot on the platform.
-10 -10   -10   9  8    8
The other foot on the train.
-10 -10 -10   9   7 -8   -6 -6  7 
I'm go--in' back to New  Orleans,
 7  -6   -6  6   5  6    -6
To wear that ba-ll and chain.
-10   -10 -10 -10   9    7 -8  -6 -6
Well there is   a house in New Orleans,
